DROPLET EXECUTOR v1.56 MANUAL:

**ANTIVIRUS DISABLED IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. (THE SYSTEM IS FALSE POSITIVE)**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[USUAGE OF DROPLET IS INTENDED FOR RAW ROBLOX, NOT MICROSOFT ROBLOX]

1. Run the "Injector" first. (This secures the Droplet system and potentially tries to find RobloxBetaPlayer)
2. If Microsoft Defender Scans and Detects a "Trojan", It is a key application for the system to function. Since the purpose of this is to execute commands into Roblox, Antiviruses can and will try to remove it because it thinks it's another attacker.
3. If any form of Defenders scan and find this as "Malware" it is advised to ignore it. This program is supposed to be commands that are executed inside a game. GitHub is a source where you can find scripts for ROBLOX.
3. After you've ran "Injector" run "Bootstrapper".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've ran everything, you're good to go!
